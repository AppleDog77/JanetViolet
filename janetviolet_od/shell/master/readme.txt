TL;DR:
Please!:
-Rename them!

YES!:
-Edit surface.txt
-Minor art edits (details, colour hues, whole menu, not use x surfaces)

NO!:
-Major art edits (keep it mostly recognisable as what it is please)

Say hi to Fairy A(nnette) and Fairy B(obette). They come with just the one dynamic pose, full facial expressions for each surface. They blink they talk and their wings flutter!
They also come with four outfit sets, each consisting of a hairstyle, dress and shoes!

All the dress ups are currently optional so, they'll appear bald and naked.

They don't have any collisions set up, if you want/need them you'll have to do them yourself.

I only named them because calling them Fairy A and Fairy B made me feel bad, so like, feel free to rename them into whatever you wish to.
