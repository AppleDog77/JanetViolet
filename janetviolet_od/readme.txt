***Janet and Violet**
By Odie (sleepysloth.turtle025@silomails.com)

One day, you find a couple of small faeries in your garden you've never seen before! At first they are of course scared, as they take great care to hide from humans for safety. But, soon a friendship forms between you and the fairies...
Very simple fairies ukagaka for Ghost Jam 2025! The fairies are really big on my monitor though, so I recommend right clicking on Janet and setting the shell scaling to 50% or so.
